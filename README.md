### Philosophy 
Presently is built on the idea that gratitude journaling should be free, private, and available to all. It will never have ads, never have a premium version, and will always be open source. Entries are kept on device and can be exported to CSV.

Presently is also built with the best Android practices in mind. It follows MVVM to separate concerns and ensure we write testable code. We require 85%+ code coverage and rely on both unit tests and instrumented tests (with a heavier weight towards unit tests). Instrumented tests are run on Firebase Test Lab, crashes are reported through Crashlytics, and analytics are reported with Firebase Analytics. 

We support several languages currently and are always looking for translators to help us! We support French, Spanish, Italian, German, Finnish, Arabic, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Slovakian, and Russian.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repo and make a PR. Forked PRs will build the app and run unit tests but will not run instrumented tests. A repo owner will run those tests as they require secret keys.
